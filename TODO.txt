1) setup server TCP connection functionality
    - Right now I am in the process of using this tutorial to try to implement
    the listener for multiple connections
        >>https://realpython.com/python-sockets/#multi-connection-server
    - Currently this is not using a message format specified by me, it seems to be implicit, so we will need to change this (I believe there are som tips at the bottom of the tutorial)
        >> Use Message Objects from and split files into libserver for messaging and appserver for logic
2) write client TCP connection functionality
    - Using same tutorial for multiconnection client
    - Split client into libclient for messaging and appclient for logic.

NOTE (1&2): ^^^ confusing code from tutorial, i am trying to make sense of it ^^^

3) write game logic
4) implement command line interaction
5) modify for multiple client multiplayer mode
6) figure out how to allow only 3 concurrent games
