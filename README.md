# Hangman_Game_Networking
This client-server code allows the communication of computers with a server hosting a the game hangman, which can be played through the command line.

The game is built upon establishing TCP connections and using the accept() method on the server side to map different clients to different ports.

How to run our code:
//complete once we have code :)
    ./server.py <host> <port>
    ./client.py <host> <port>
